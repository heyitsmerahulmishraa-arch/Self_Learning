## What are Executable Files?

Executable files are files that can be run as a program. They contain instructions that the computer can execute directly. In Windows, executable files typically have the `.exe` extension, while in Unix-like systems (such as Linux and macOS), they may not have a specific extension but must have the executable permission set.

When you run an executable file, the operating system loads it into memory and executes the instructions contained within it. This allows you to perform various tasks, such as opening applications, running scripts, or executing commands.

In the context of Node.js, executable files can be JavaScript files that are run using the Node.js runtime. For example, if you have a file named `app.js`, you can execute it using the command:

```bash
node app.js
```

This will run the JavaScript code contained in `app.js` using the Node.js runtime, allowing you to perform tasks such as creating a server, processing data, or interacting with databases.
Executable files can also be created using tools like `pkg` or `nexe`, which bundle your Node.js application into a standalone executable that can be run without requiring the user to have Node.js installed.
In summary, executable files are essential for running programs and scripts on a computer. They allow you to execute code and perform various tasks, making them a fundamental part of software development and usage.
