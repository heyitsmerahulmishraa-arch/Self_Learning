## What is OS and Kernel?

### What is OS?
OS stands for Operating System. It is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. The OS acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware. It allows users to interact with the computer without needing to understand the underlying hardware.

### What is Kernel?
The kernel is the core component of an operating system. It is responsible for managing the system's resources, such as the CPU, memory, and input/output devices. The kernel provides a layer of abstraction between the hardware and software, allowing applications to interact with the hardware without needing to know the details of how it works. The kernel handles tasks such as process management, memory management, and device management. It ensures that different applications can run simultaneously without interfering with each other and that the system remains stable and secure.

In summary, the OS is the overall software that manages the computer, while the kernel is the central part of the OS that handles the core functions and resource management.
