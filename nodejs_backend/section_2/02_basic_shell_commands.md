## Basic Shell Commands (echo, pwd, whoami)

In this section, we will cover some basic shell commands that are essential for navigating and interacting with the terminal. These commands include `echo`, `pwd`, and `whoami`.

### 1. `echo`
The `echo` command is used to display a line of text or a variable value in the terminal. It is commonly used to print messages or the values of environment variables.
```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
This command will output:
```
Hello, World!
```
You can also use `echo` to display the value of an environment variable. For example:
```bash
echo $HOME
```
This command will output the path to your home directory.

### 2. `pwd`
The `pwd` command stands for "print working directory". It is used to display the current directory you are in within the terminal.
```bash
pwd
```
When you run this command, it will output the full path of the current directory. For example:
```
/home/user/projects
```

### 3. `whoami`
The `whoami` command is used to display the username of the current user. This can be useful for confirming which user account you are operating under, especially when working with multiple accounts or when using sudo.
```bash
whoami
```
When you run this command, it will output your username. For example:
```
user
```

### Conclusion
These basic shell commands are fundamental for navigating and interacting with the terminal. The `echo` command allows you to display messages and variable values, `pwd` helps you keep track of your current directory, and `whoami` confirms your user identity. Familiarizing yourself with these commands will enhance your efficiency when working in the terminal.
