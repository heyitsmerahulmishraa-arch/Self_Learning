## What is Backend & Client Server Architecture ?

### What is Backend ?
Backend is the part of a software application that is responsible for processing and managing data, handling business logic, and providing services to the frontend (client-side) of the application. It typically includes the server, database, and application logic that runs on the server. The backend is responsible for tasks such as user authentication, data storage, and processing requests from the frontend.

### What is Client-Server Architecture ?
Client-Server Architecture is a software design pattern that divides an application into two main components: the client and the server. The client is the part of the application that interacts with the user, while the server is responsible for processing requests from the client and providing responses. In this architecture, the client sends requests to the server, which processes the requests and returns the appropriate responses. This separation allows for better scalability, maintainability, and security in software applications. The client can be a web browser, mobile app, or any other interface that interacts with the server, while the server can be a web server, application server, or database server that handles the backend logic and data management.
