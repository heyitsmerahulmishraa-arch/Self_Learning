## CLI vs GUI

### CLI (Command Line Interface)
- A CLI is a text-based interface where users interact with the system by typing commands.
- It is often used by developers and system administrators for tasks that require precision and speed.
- CLI allows for automation through scripting and can be more efficient for certain tasks.
- Examples of CLI tools include Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt on Windows, and Bash on Linux.

### GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- A GUI is a visual interface that allows users to interact with the system through graphical elements such as buttons, icons, and menus.
- It is designed to be user-friendly and is often used by non-technical users.
- GUI can be more intuitive and easier to learn for beginners, but it may be less efficient for advanced users who need to perform complex tasks quickly.
- Examples of GUI applications include web browsers, file explorers, and office software.
