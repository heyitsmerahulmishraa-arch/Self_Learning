## Why do we need node.js and how is it different from javascript?

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and provides a platform for building server-side applications.
JavaScript, on the other hand, is a programming language that is primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers. It is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages.
The main difference between Node.js and JavaScript is that Node.js is a runtime environment that allows
you to run JavaScript code on the server-side, while JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers. Node.js provides additional features and modules that are not available in the browser, such as file system access, network communication, and the ability to create server applications. This makes Node.js a powerful tool for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.

In summary, Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side, while JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers. Node.js provides additional features and modules that make it suitable for building server-side applications, while JavaScript is mainly used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages.
