## Character Sets vs Character Encodings (ASCII and Unicode)

### Character Sets
A character set is a collection of characters that can be used in a particular context. For example, the ASCII character set includes 128 characters, including letters, digits, and special symbols. The Unicode character set, on the other hand, includes over 143,000 characters from various languages and scripts around the world.

### Character Encodings
A character encoding is a way of representing characters from a character set as bytes. For example,the ASCII character set can be represented using a single byte (8 bits) for each character, while the Unicode character set can be represented using multiple bytes (up to 4 bytes) for each character, depending on the encoding used (e.g., UTF-8, UTF-16).

### Conclusion
In summary, a character set defines the characters that can be used, while a character encoding defines how those characters are represented as bytes. The ASCII character set is limited to 128 characters and can be represented using a single byte, while the Unicode character set includes a much larger number of characters and can be represented using multiple bytes depending on the encoding used.
