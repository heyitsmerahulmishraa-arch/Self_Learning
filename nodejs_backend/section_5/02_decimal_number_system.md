## Decimal number system

The decimal number system, also known as the base-10 system, is the most commonly used number system in everyday life. It is based on ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each digit's position in a number determines its value, with the rightmost digit representing the units place (10^0), the next digit to the left representing the tens place (10^1), and so on. For example, the number 345 can be broken down as follows:
- 3 in the hundreds place (10^2) contributes 300
- 4 in the tens place (10^1) contributes 40
- 5 in the units place (10^0) contributes 5
Thus, the total value of the number 345 is 300 + 40 + 5 = 345.

The decimal system is widely used in various fields, including mathematics, science, engineering, and finance. It is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers. In computing, while the binary system is fundamental for data representation, the decimal system is often used for user interfaces and applications that require human interaction, as it is more intuitive for people to understand and work with.
In programming languages, decimal numbers can be represented using various data types, such as integers and floating-point numbers. For instance, in JavaScript, you can declare a decimal number like this:

```javascript
let decimalNumber = 3.14;
```

In this example, `decimalNumber` is a floating-point number that represents the value 3.14. The decimal system allows for the representation of both whole numbers and fractional values, making it versatile for a wide range of applications.
