## What is React? Why is it used?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive user experience. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used in web development due to its efficiency and flexibility. React allows developers to create reusable UI components, which can manage their own state and be composed to build complex user interfaces. It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize rendering performance, making it faster than traditional methods of updating the DOM. React is also popular for its unidirectional data flow, which helps in managing the state of applications more predictably. Overall, React is used to create dynamic and responsive web applications with ease.
